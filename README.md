## Overview

This repository contains the models used throughout CaTH application.

This project produces a single maven artefact, pushed up to Azure DevOps Artifacts, which is then used by other CaTH services.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

#### General

The version number no longer needs to be updated manually in the build.gradle. This is done automatically via the publishing process (See steps below).

- [Java JDK 17](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/17/) - this is used throughout all of our services.

##### Local development

No specific requirements, other than the standard IDE and Java 17.

### Installation

- Clone the repository
- Build using the command `./gradlew clean build`

#### Publishing the library

This project is a library rather than a spring boot application.

#### Publishing the library Locally

To publish the application to the local repository, use

```bash
  ./gradlew clean build publishToMavenLocal
```
The JAR that is published is also accessible in build/libs/

Running this locally will create a version called 'DEV-SNAPSHOT' which can then be used in the other projects.

#### Publishing the library via Azure DevOps Artefacts

Publishing to Azure DevOps Artefacts is done automatically on Pull Request, and on the creation of a release.

When a pull request is first created, or when a commit is made to it, a new artefact is created in the artefact store. The name of this is in the format of "BranchName-CommitHash"

This version can then be used in the associated PR's in other microservices for testing

Once the PR has been merged, a release should be created with a tag set to the new version. This tag will become the dependency version, e.g. 2.3.5.

#### Importing the library

The library can be imported into other projects by using

```bash
  implementation group: 'uk.gov.hmcts.reform', name: 'pip-data-models', version: '0.0.1'
```

in your build.gradle file

### Fortify

We use Fortify to scan for security vulnerabilities. This is run as part of our nightly pipelines.

## Test Suite

This library is comprehensively tested using a suite of unit tests.

### Unit tests

Unit tests can be run on demand using `./gradlew test`.
